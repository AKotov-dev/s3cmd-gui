# S3cmd-GUI
GUI for Command line tool for managing Amazon S3: https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd  

Mageia Linux lacks the `s3cmd` rpm package. Before installing `s3cmd-gui`, download and install the s3cmd rpm package from the `s3cmd-rpm` folder. In other cases, the availability of the s3cmd package depends on the distribution.

Immediately after the launch, the S3cmd-GUI tries to connect to the cloud storage. To configure the connection, click the button with the `Gear` icon. Selecting several objects (except buckets) in the file manager - `Ctrl+LMouse`, canceling long copy operations - `Esc` button. Tested in Mageia-8/LUbutu-20.10.
