# s3cmd-gui
GUI for Command Line S3 Client (Amazon). 

Mageia Linux lacks the `s3cmd` rpm package. Before installing `s3cmd-gui`, download and install the s3cmd rpm package from the `s3cmd-rpm` folder.

After launching `s3cmd-gui` (Menu-Utility-System), enter the identification data (the button with the image of a `Gear`) and click "Ok" button.
