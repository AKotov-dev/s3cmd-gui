# s3cmd-gui
GUI for Command Line S3 Client (Amazon). 

Mageia Linux lacks the `s3cmd` rpm package. Before installing `s3cmd-gui`, download and install the s3cmd rpm package from the `s3cmd-rpm` folder.

After launching `s3cmd-gui` (Menu-Utility-System), enter the identification data (the button with the image of a `Gear`) and click "Ok" button. Tested in Mageia-8/LUbutu-20.10. Amazon S3 Tools: Command Line S3 Client Software and S3 Backup URL: https://s3tools.org/usage
